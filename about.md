## Biography ##

First and foremost, I am a Christian. In other words, I have trusted in <a href="http://www.aweandreverence.com/gospel/what-is-the-gospel/248" target="_blank">the gospel of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ</a> by the <strong>amazing grace</strong> of God: I am a <strong>sinner</strong> who once was desperately <strong>lost</strong> beyond all hope, but is now forgiven and found by the rich immeasurable love and vast mercies of God. "<em>But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us</em>" (Romans 5:8).

I'm <a href="http://jands2011.com" target="_blank">married to Shannon</a>, my best friend and dearest companion. I became a father for the first time in July 2013, when my son was born. After treasuring my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, my wife and son are more important to me than anything in <em>this</em> world.

As a <a href="http://talentral.com/profile/jontsai" target="_blank">software-hacker-generalist-ninja-entrepreneur</a> by skill/trade/training who graduated from <a href="https://cal.berkeley.edu/jontsai" target="_blank">Berkeley CS</a>, I'm incredibly lazy and diligent at the same time--which forces me to be creative and automate things. For me, crafting software is a union of right-brain <strong>and</strong> left-brain activity--an artistic pursuit melded with deep technical analysis, resulting in pure elegance.

I really enjoy <a href="http://pkkup.com/profile/jontsai" target="_blank">basketball</a>, swimming, <a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/jontsai" target="_blank">cycling</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jontsai" target="_blank">music</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/jontsai8601" target="_blank">photography</a>, good writing, learning to speak different languages with an accurate pronunciation, and reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
