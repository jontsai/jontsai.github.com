I am a consumer--I play, watch, listen, eat, drink, read, absorb, use--I consume. Here, I've put together a list of products and services that I like and recommend.

My favorite retailer, by and large, is Amazon. There is where I buy everything from toilet paper and coconut oil to camera lenses and laptops. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=jontsai-20" target="_blank">Shop at Amazon and support this site</a>
