I'm newer to open-sourcing projects of my own on GitHub, so it'll take me some time to "wrap" things properly and provide some documentation and examples so that these projects are more useful to others. I think sharing is viral, and I want to thank the open-source community for making it what it is today. I love what [Jade Dominguez](http://plusjade.com) has done with [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com). Through him, I also learned about Derek Siver's post on the [benefits of sharing](http://sivers.org/sharing).

Projects worth mentioning:

* [Exaile-HTTP-Server](https://github.com/jontsai/Exaile-HTTP-Server)
* [js-calendar-widget](https://github.com/jontsai/js-calendar-widget)
