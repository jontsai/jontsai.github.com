**tl;dr;**

If this is you:

* Android developer with an Intel-based computer
* Sick of dealing with a slow emulator

Then:

* Install [Intel HAXM (Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager)](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager)

I never knew this, and thought that I was doomed to a slow emulator or had to debug and deploy over a constantly plugged-in device, which could at times be inconvenient.

Thanks to the guys at [CodePath](http://thecodepath.com) ([@thecodepath](http://twitter.com/thecodepath)) for this useful tip! If you're interested in learning iOS or Android, definitely check them out.
