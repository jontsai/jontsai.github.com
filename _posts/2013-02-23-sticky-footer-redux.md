I call myself a generalist, but feel that I'm more adept at backend development than web frontend, so I'm always amazed by the simplicity and cleverness of really cool HTML/CSS/JS techniques out there.

1. [Responsive Sticky Footer](http://timothy-long.com/responsive-sticky-footer/) by Timothy Long \[[demo](http://timothy-long.com/examples/responsive-sticky-footer/)\] \[[code](https://github.com/timothylong/Responsive-Sticky-Footer)\]

  This was very informative. I have yet to use this solution (maybe when I need a dynamically-sized footer), but it seems to be very promising--not to mention that the solution is very clever.

1. [CSSSitckyFooter](http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/) \[[code](http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/style.css)\]

  I've been using this exact technique for several (dozens) websites, and it's a tried-and-true method.

1. Another [CSS Sticky Footer](http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/) by Ryan Fait \[[code](http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/layout.css)\]

  I haven't used this one, but it's neat to see the code in action and how few lines it requires.

On a separate note, I recently started using [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), a dynamic stylesheet language which allows you to write less CSS by using variables and functions. I can't emphasize enough that it's a HUGE timesaver. It's a must-have for any project.
