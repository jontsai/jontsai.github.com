In order to learn, there are three kinds of questions to ask: **What?**, **How?**, and **Why**?

Of these, **Why?** is the best question to ask, and **What?** is the worst; **How?** is in the middle but right near the bottom near **What?**.

The reason **Why?** is the best question for learning is that it conditions you to go to *first principles* and *learn how to learn*.

**What?** is the absolute worst type of question to ask, because usually the answer to **What?** is a reference lookup away. A better question to ask is: **Where?** can I find my own answer to my **What?** question?

Likewise, **How?** is rarely a good question to ask. Knowing *how* to do something is different from being *able* to do it. The answers to **How?** questions are best answered by not asking it directly, but rather by finding an expert who already possesses the knowledge of **How?**, and simply watch that master at work. To achieve this level of mastery takes years upon years of honing oneâ€™s craft, and the answer to **How?** is rarely succinctly communicable, therefore frustrating both the mentor and the apprentice. Instead, just **Watch and learn**.

Hopefully, at whatever institution you are in, you are surrounded by individuals who have mastered the **How?** and you can find opportunities to learn from them. If not, there are plentiful and abundant (not to mention, free) resources online to learn **How?**, such as YouTube. So, really, **How?** is a pretty bad question to ask since it is actually a series of **What?** questions in disguise. Instead of asking **How?**, just observe those who already know how and *do*, and as you observe, find opportunities to ask them, **Why?**. And, if they are not available, a still better question is, **Where?** can I find the resources to learn **How?**
