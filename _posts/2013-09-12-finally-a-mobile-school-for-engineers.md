Got an email today about a new Android training program starting up in SF for engineers. Best of all, it's free!

I'm definitely going to check them out and try to sign up.

_Update (2013-09-15)_:
If you're unable to attend the class, they may have a "course observer option where you will have access to all the materials for the class, but you just wonâ€™t participate in the live classes, discussion forums, or the group projects."

Jonathan,

I'm a co-founder of CodePath, a startup that runs iOS and Android training programs. We've trained hundreds of engineers at Yahoo who are moving from web development to mobile development.
 
We're offering the same training program to engineers in the bay area for free.  It's a project-based course, meets twice a week for 6 weeks, and the next class begins on October 2nd (another one starts in January).  It's an intensive program, but we've seen great results with it.
 
We're currently accepting engineers with a technical degree OR at least two years of object-oriented programming experience.  If you're interested, sign up here:
* [Android class, starting October 2](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/androidbootcamp2)
* [Android class, starting January 15](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/jan_android_bootcamp)
* [iOS class, starting October 2](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/mobileiosbootcamp)
* [iOS class, starting January 15](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/jan_ios_bootcamp)

Please forward to any engineers or mailing lists that might be appropriate, additional details below.
