It's 2015, and from time to time I still see a lot of `==` peppered throughout codebases that I work with, and just wanted to share a few posts that might change your mind =)

**tl;dr;**

`===` and its complement `!==` and should be used like 99% of the time because it is faster and more accurate.

    > 0 == "0"
    < true
    > 0 === "0"
    < false
    > 0 == false
    < true
    > "0" == false // really?
    < true
    > !!"0"
    < true
    > !"0"
    < false
    > "0" === false
    < false

There are more perverse and mind-bending examples that are out there, but Iâ€™ll leave you with those for now.

As you can see, the former `==` does type coercion, which is lazy way of doing comparisons without casting data explicitly, and can find yourself in hot water down the line. The latter `===` does type checking first, and then checks equality of the values.

**Protip #1**: If you want to test a JS expression or figure out some syntax really quickly, just open your JS console in the browser inspect tool.

**Protip #2**: If testing for something *truthy* or *falsy*, a nice trick is to just do use the `!` operator twice (`!!`). As can be seen above, JS treats non-empty strings as a *truthy* (yet, strangely, `"0" == false`)
