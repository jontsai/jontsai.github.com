On Sunday, February 3, 2013 (Super Bowl Sunday), Domino's Pizza disabled ShopRunner free delivery on their site. This screenshot was taken from the [Domino's Order Page](https://order.dominos.com/en/pages/order/?route=1#/locations/search/) on Tuesday, February 5, 2013, when they added it back in.

Coincidence? Sneaky Domino's. I didn't think to take a screenshot at the time, though. Too bad!
