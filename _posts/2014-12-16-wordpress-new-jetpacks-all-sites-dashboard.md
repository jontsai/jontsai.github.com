The JetPacks 3.3 upgrade that allows you to manage and administer multiple WordPress sites from one WordPress.com account is a breeze to use!

I'm not quite used to it yet and still getting acclimated, but I think it's a great time-saver and will grow on me more over time.

I can see it as a great feature to use once a site for daily workflows in updating content once a site's major structural and design work has been done.

Cheers to the WordPress team for this great feature!
